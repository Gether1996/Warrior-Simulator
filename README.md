 ~ description, what am I doing here?
 
 Features:
 - Serialization system. Scalable serialization interface implementation that uses waterfall-like saving and loading of serializable objects into and from JSON.
 - Simple console GUI. Used for data visualization and simulation control.
 - Wide array of object's permutation. Gladiator classes with different races, traits, attributes that controls each Gladiator's ability to perform in combat.
 - World variability. Almost every significant object has it's own name generator to ensure no two worlds are the same.
 - Item system. weapons and armors. Uses simple JSON database to load data into the game. Items are accessible for gladiators to use.
 - Statistics system. Each participant in our simulator is gathering data for evaluation later on.
 - Configuration system. All important variables that controls the game on systematic level are read from configuration .ini file, where they are easily accessed for further changes in game design.
