Since we are doing gladiator rome simulator, we should solve our name generation for the arenas.
We are going to create simple database for that.

Use this website https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/roman-town-names.php

and generate at least 100 town names and copy paste them into .txt file so the file looks like this:

Brigetio
Isca Dumnoniorum
Bellunum
Casilinum
Canatha
Anio
Castellum Apud Confluentes
Caesena
Oppidum Atuaticorum
Tifernum Tiberinum

...

Save this file next to our project, and load the names into a list of strings in config.py,
use this list to initialize the name of the arena upon arena's creation. The name is chosen from the
list by random.
