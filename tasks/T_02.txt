# Introduce new python file that will contain all global variables that will be used as settings
- You can include this new python file to our main file and use variables from the new file
- The new python file will have option to load and initialize the variables from JSON file
- For starters, we can have two global variables that will be initialized this way: NumOfSimulatedDays
and LengthOfArenaSchedule.
One will be under 'World' category, the second one under 'Arena' category. The resulting JSON file could look like
this:
- Our main file will be using variables initialized this way (so that will replace our current implementation which
is a 'magic number' at the moment)

[World]
NumOfSimulatedDays = 500

[Arena]
LengthOfArenaSchedule = 5
